# Student Exam Performance Prediction  Machine Learning & Data Analysis
In this project, I explored a rich dataset of 6,607 student records to uncover the key factors influencing academic performance. Using Python, I performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and outlier handling with Z-score and RobustScaler techniques. I applied label encoding to categorical variables and built predictive models to estimate exam scores based on academic habits, socio-economic background, and personal attributes.
## Key features 
analyzed included hours studied, attendance, parental involvement, motivation level, internet access, tutoring sessions, sleep hours, and more. Through visualization and modeling, I identified high-impact predictors and gained insights into how different factors shape student outcomes.
## Tools & Techniques:
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, LabelEncoder, RobustScaler, Regression Models
## Outcome:
Built a scalable pipeline for educational data analysis and prediction, with potential applications in early intervention, personalized learning, and academic support systems.
